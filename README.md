# Library Management System

Welcome to the Library Management System, a modern and intuitive platform designed to streamline and enhance the management of library operations. This project leverages the power of React.js for the frontend and Spring Boot for the backend, providing a robust and scalable solution for libraries of all sizes.

## Project Overview

The Library Management System is built to address the common challenges faced by libraries in managing their resources and users. With a user-friendly interface and powerful backend, this system ensures efficient handling of library operations, including user management, book borrowing, and return tracking.

## Key Features

- **User Management**: Effortlessly manage profiles of students, employees, and administrators. The system allows for easy addition, editing, and deletion of user information, ensuring that the library's user database is always up-to-date.
- **Efficient Borrowing System**: Keep track of book borrowing and return dates with ease. The system provides a clear overview of borrowed books, due dates, and overdue items, helping librarians maintain order and accountability.
- **Admin Dashboard**: A dedicated dashboard for administrators to oversee and manage all library operations. The dashboard provides quick access to user management, book inventory, and borrowing records.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across all devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
- **Secure Authentication**: Implemented secure user authentication and authorization to protect sensitive data and ensure that only authorized personnel have access to administrative functions.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend

- **React.js**: A powerful JavaScript library for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
- **Bootstrap**: A popular CSS framework for creating responsive and mobile-first web pages.
- **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests to the backend.

### Backend

- **Spring Boot**: A robust Java-based framework for building production-ready applications with ease.
- **Spring Data JPA**: Simplifies the implementation of data access layers using JPA (Java Persistence API).
- **MySQL**: A reliable and widely-used relational database management system for storing and managing data.

### Development Tools

- **Visual Studio Code**: A versatile and powerful code editor for writing and debugging code.
- **Git**: A distributed version control system for tracking changes and collaborating on code.
- **GitHub**: A platform for hosting and managing code repositories, facilitating collaboration and version control.
